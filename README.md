A clean and minimal web-based Expense Tracker built with Flask, HTML, and CSS.
It allows users to quickly add expenses and view them in a neatly formatted list — all inside a simple and visually pleasant UI designed to match a custom Figma/Canva-style mockup.

1. Add an expense with a title and amount
2. Automatically displays expenses in a bullet-point list
3. Custom UI design inspired by a Canva mockup
4. Clean layout using Poppins and League Spartan fonts
5. Lightweight Flask backend
6. Organized project structure (templates + static files)


Technologies Used:
1. Python (Flask)
2. HTML / CSS
3. Google Fonts (Poppins & League Spartan)
4. Jinja2 Templates
